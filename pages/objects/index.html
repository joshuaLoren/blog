        <h1>Objects</h1>
        <p>
          When you are creating objects in Java, you are creating an instance of a class. Classes can
          extend classes by way of inheritance. In JavaScript objects do not need to be an instance of
          a class.
        </p>

              We will start start by creating an object in Java. We create objects by creating instances of classes.
              The Scanner class is build into the Java API and will need to be imported using java.util.Scanner;.

              <p> and the desired output: </p><br><br>
              <img src="images\objecExampleConsoleOutput.PNG" alt="console output">
              <p> Lets take a look at the code: </p><br>
              <p><strong>import java.util.Scanner;</strong><br>
              Here we are importing the class Scanner, by doing so,
              we have access to all of Scanner's methods. We will take
              a closer look at classes later. </p><br>
              <p>Take a close look at line 16: <strong>Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);</strong><br>
              Scanner is the class, and we are creating a new instance of this class. The reference variable,
              "keyboard", is what we will name the instance. By creating an instance of the Scanner class, we
              have created a Scanner object that will have access to all of Scanner's methods (functions).</p>
              <p>This is demonstrated in line 22: <strong>name = keyboard.nextline()</strong><br>
              Our Scanner object (keyboard), has access to the Scanner class, and uses the method nextLine().
              If we were to take a look at the Scanner class we would see a method called nextLine(), that reads
              the next String input by the user.
              <br><p>Now, lets have a look at creating an object in JavaScript.</p><br>
              <img src="images\jsObjectCode.PNG" alt="object example">
              <p> and the desired output: </p><br><br>
              <img src="images\jsObjectOutput.PNG" alt="console output">
              <p> Lets take a look at the code: </p><br>
              <p><strong>var computer = {ram : "16 GB", hardDrive : 1 TB 5400 rpm, graphicsCard: "GeForce GTX 1050"}</strong><br>
              In JavaScript we have name:value pairs called properties. A JavaScript object is essentially
              a container for naming properties. One way to access an object property is to use the objectsName.propName.
              This is just a basic example, but the point of this tutorial is to demonstrate how in a class based language
              like Java objects inherit methods from classes, while in a nonclass language like JavaScript objects inherit methods
              (functions) from objects. More to come on this later. </p>
